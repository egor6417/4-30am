	<h2>"Destined for War" Impression </h2>
	<i>please note: this impression is an excerpt from a letter to my friend.</i>
	<p>I found "Destined for War" strange in a way, because I did not quite understand the target audience- are they businessmen trying to draw parallels to their businesses? Are they politicians trying to avoid a world war? Are they merely curious humans? However, understanding the target audience is not an important part of a book, and I enjoyed everything else. It is well-written without coming off as snobby, which I also liked. For what it's worth, I understand the Trap is important, but it is extremely hard to change subconscious thinking.</p>
